## First Project - Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

This is the solution to a project for the subject of _Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms_. The problem given could be reduced to finding the cut vertices in a graph. I have also included the report, written in Portuguese, that analyses the solution, as well as some Python scripts written to get a rough estimate of how the algorithm's time grows when the input grows (the way it generates graphs is not very smart, but it was enough to confirm that it behaved as expected).
